            Kassa Hailu was born into a country rife with civil war, and he defeated many regional
            noblemen and princes before becoming emperor during time known as the Zemene Mesafint
            or "Age of the Princes". During this era, regional princes, and noble lords of diverse
            ethnic and religious backgrounds vied with each other for power and control of the Gondarine Emperor.
        </p>
        <p>Tewodros II (Ge'ez: ዳግማዊ ቴዎድሮስ, once referred to by the English cognate Theodore; 
            baptized as Kassa, c. 1818 – 13 April 1868) was Emperor of Ethiopia from 1855 until 
            his death in 1868. His rule is often placed as the beginning of modern Ethiopia and 
            brought an end to the decentralized Zemene Mesafint (Era of the Princes)
        </p>
        <p>
            Kassa began his career in this era as a shifta (outlaw), but after amassing a sizable
            force of followers, was able to not only restore himself to his father's previous fiefdom
            of Qwara but was able to control all of Dembiya. Moreover, he gained popular support by his 
            benevolent treatment of the inhabitants in the areas he controlled: according to Sven Rubenson, 
            Kassa "shared out captured grain and money to the peasants in Qwara and told them to buy hoes and plant."
        </p>
        <p>Tewodros II's first task after having reunited the other provinces was to bring Shewa
           under his control. During the Era of the Princes, Shewa was, even more than most provinces,
           an independent entity, its ruler even styling himself Negus, the title for King.
           In the course of subduing the Shewans, Tewodros took with him a Shewan prince, 
           Sahle Maryam, who he brought up as his own son, who would later become Emperor (or Atse) 
           himself as Menelik II.
        </p>
        <p>On 15 April 1868, as the British troops stormed the citadel of Magdala, Emperor 
           Tewodros committed suicide rather than surrender.
            A modern commentator states "When Tewodros preferred self-inflicted death to captivity, 
            he deprived the British of this ultimate satisfaction and laid the foundation for his own 
            resurrection as a symbol of the defiant independence of the Ethiopian.
